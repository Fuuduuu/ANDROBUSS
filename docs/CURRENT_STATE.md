# CURRENT_STATE

## Repository Baseline

- Expected repo root: `C:\Users\Kasutaja\Desktop\ANDROBUSS`
- Expected branch: `main`
- Latest accepted HEAD: `0d09b36` (`PASS_23`)
- Working tree must be clean before a new pass

## Latest Accepted Pass

- `PASS_23 — FEED_SNAPSHOT_IMPORTER_AND_CI_TEST`

PASS 21 added a parser-agnostic feed boundary and in-memory provider bootstrap.

PASS 22A confirms storage-identity strategy for future Room baseline:
- GTFS `stop_id` and `tripId`-derived pattern IDs are treated as feed/city-local identifiers.
- Future storage keys must be city/feed-scoped:
  - stop-point key: `cityId + feedId + stopId`
  - route-pattern key: `cityId + feedId + patternId`
  - pattern-stop key: `cityId + feedId + patternId + sequence`

## Current Core Status

- `core-domain`, `core-gtfs`, `core-routing`, `city-adapters`, and `feature-search` pure Kotlin search stack are implemented and tested.
- `DomainFeedSnapshot` and `DomainFeedSnapshotProvider` now live in `core-domain`.
- `feature-search` keeps `InMemoryDomainFeedSnapshot` as an in-memory implementation.
- `data-local` now includes Room baseline schema + DAO + mapper + load-then-serve provider using scoped keys:
  - stop-point key: `cityId + feedId + stopId`
  - route-pattern key: `cityId + feedId + patternId`
  - pattern-stop key: `cityId + feedId + patternId + sequence`
- `feature-search` has test-scope parser integration only:
  - `testImplementation(project(":core-gtfs"))`
- No production parser dependency from feature-search runtime code.
- `RoomDomainFeedSnapshotProvider` caches snapshots by `CityId` and is prepared by explicit `prepare(cityId, feedId)` calls.
- PASS 23 added production `FeedSnapshotImporter` so domain snapshots can be written into Room.
- PASS 23 also added parser -> domain snapshot -> Room -> provider -> search-pipeline integration coverage and CI `./gradlew test` step.
- PASS 24 documents MVP runtime bootstrap policy: bundled APK feed asset first, runtime downloader later.

## Not Implemented Yet

- Production route-pattern source/provider wiring
- Production feed downloader/refresh flow
- App/ViewModel runtime wiring of the pipeline
- Bundled feed bootstrap app-layer implementation
- Nearest-stop/geospatial resolution
- UI feature flows

## Current Risks

- Room-backed snapshot/provider baseline is implemented but not wired into app runtime.
- Room baseline exists, but runtime wiring, freshness metadata, and feed lifecycle policy are not implemented.
- Production `RoutePattern` source is not implemented.
- UI/ViewModel wiring is not implemented.
- Nearest-stop/geospatial behavior is not implemented.
- `rakvere-smoke` names are synthetic and separate from real Rakvere POI metadata names.
- First-launch `FeedNotReady` state is expected before bootstrap prepare and is not an error state.

## Current Pass

- `PASS_24 — FEED_BOOTSTRAP_AND_RUNTIME_WIRING_DECISION` (docs-only)

## Governance Bootstrap (PASS_G01)

- Added compact governance scaffold docs:
  - `docs/PROJECT_STATE.yml`
  - `docs/INVARIANTS.md`
  - `docs/DEBUG_PLAYBOOK.md`
  - `docs/PASS_TEMPLATE.md`
- No runtime/source/build behavior changes.

## Governance Validation (PASS_G02)

- Added `tools/validate_project_state.py` for compact `docs/PROJECT_STATE.yml` schema checks.
- Validator is runnable locally and is wired into CI.
- Local Windows validator command: `py -3 tools/validate_project_state.py`.

## Next Technical Pass

- `PASS 25 — BUNDLED_FEED_BOOTSTRAP_APP_LAYER`
